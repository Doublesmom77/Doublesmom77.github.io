					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry to hear about your FIL. That&#039;s happening very frequently I am hearing. My whole family is liberal like me-but my friends are a mixture of liberal, moderate, and conservative, and I know I&#039;ve offended some of those folks which was never my intention. I feel badly about making people I care about angry, but I also feel frustrated because I&#039;m all... how can they be so....wrong?? I agree 100% with your last 2 sentences. Things are changing-and not for the better. I am frightened.
Thank you for the comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am with you!  Adolf Spraytan!!!  I am having a hard time keeping my opinions to myself and have fought with numerous family members on Facebook.  In fact, my father-in-law unfriended me - lol. Thanksgiving is going to be interesting to say the least.  Don&#039;t let anyone tell you to be quiet or to get over it.  What is happening in our country is monumental and radical and there is nothing normal about it!]]></description>
