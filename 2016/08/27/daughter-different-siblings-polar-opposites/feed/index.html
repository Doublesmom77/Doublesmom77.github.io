					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s so funny! I say that my first looks and acts exactly like me, and my second looks and acts nothing like me, so I wonder..... since my second was an IVF baby! (my first was not.) Of course I&#039;m joking as luckily I know S2 is mine because though she looks and acts nothing like her sister or me, she is the spitting image of my husband. Acts exactly like him too! She is definitely the son I never had. :) Thanks for the comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha ha!! I have twin boys. This translates: I raise them simultaneously, &#039;cause other than that, they&#039;re everything BUT twins. They are so different in every possible way, I wonder if one of them had not been exchanged at the clinic...]]></description>
