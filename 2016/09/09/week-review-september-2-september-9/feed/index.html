					<description><![CDATA[The no air conditioning thing is so tough though it&#039;s only a problem in September and May-June, really (which is why we start and finish the school year later over here than the majority of the country.) the taxes here are already so high though and districts are so pinched for cash-a/c isn&#039;t even on the radar. And I agree with your take on magazines. I get Discovery Girls for my oldest and Highlights Hello for the baby and those past the feminist test, thankfully. Though my oldest is more a novel reader than a magazine fan-she is obsessed with YA dystopian fiction. I&#039;m totally cool with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment! I actually commented on that list of yours under &quot;doublesmom77.&quot; I will subscribe in a moment, too!
My oldest clung to my leg and cried for many periods of her daycare journey. I&#039;d much rather be ignored! Thought asked her if she remembered having to be peeled off of me, crying hysterically as I left for work (none too happy) and she said no. Finding that out was a huge relief.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s so bad that none of the schools have air conditioning! Especially if you see temperatures like that that often! Still though, apart from the heat, it sounds like you&#039;re settling into your new job well and that your kids are settling well too! Magazines are always going to be an issue, I do understand that there are girls who want fashion and others who want science, why not have an entire collection of different genres of magazines for girls AND boys. It would make life so much easier, and give across a better sense of &#039;you really can do what you want&#039;.]]></description>
